# feel free to switch the mathmatical symbol
answer = base * base + height * height

### next divide back of triangles
back_1 = 1
back_2 = 0.8
## print them both divided by eachother back_2 first
print('this is the dividend of both backs')
dividend = back_2/back_1 
print dividend

# copy and paste the output of the square root of "answer" and multiply it by "dividend"
answer_2 = dividend * 12.0415945788
print('this should be your final answer not squared')
