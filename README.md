# pythagorean-theorem
This code was one of the first calculators that I built so it is really as simple as it looks.
just input the numbers and run the code.
I wrote this code when I just turned 16. I was bored and just needed something to do.
So this can be used by the lazy people that know how to do pythagorean theorem but just don't want to.
or it can be used by people who don't want to and don't know how to, so they basically cheat.
